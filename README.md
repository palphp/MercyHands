Improving the way we care about each others
=========

## Description

Imagine saving a life of 10 years old kid suffering from cancer, that would be such a great effort of you, it would be a small contribution from you with the help from other people and that kid can start his treatments.
We came up with "Mercy Hands" system , which will be a good contribution to humanity, a system that will help us to care about each others.

Its not just cancer, there are a big list of killing deceases all over the world, a lot of people suffer from those deceases.

"Mercy Hands" aims to provide tools so we can fight deceases as well as helping those who can't find medical care for facial reasons.

"Mercy Hands" system is very easy to use , it take less than 5 minutes for the user to register and start a campaign to "Save a Saul", once the campaign is published.
Contributors from all over the world can support each other to "Save the Saul"; and once goal is completed , the system will notify contributors and release the funding to the campaign owner.

## Future passion
As Coders , we in PALPHP believe  we can improve the system functionality; 40 Hours of hard coding by 4 developers bring this idea to be a good opportunity for a lot of people around the world.
We are very sure we can develop, enhance and maintain it later.
